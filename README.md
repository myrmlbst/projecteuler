# Project Euler Solutions

## About Project Euler
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of challenging mathematical/computational problems intended to be solved with computer algorithms. One new problem of varying difficulty is added to the database approximately every week. The solutions for problems at Project Euler generally consist of two parts:

- **Part 1:** Finding a mathematical method to break down the problem's structure into its elements
- **Part 2:** Developing an efficient algorithm to apply said mathematical concept and solve the problem

## Why Project Euler?
I personally chose Project Euler for two reasons: to _further develop my mathematical reasoning and logic_, and to _expand my knowledge on computer algorithms_ that are less common or not taught to computer science undergrad students.
